# Zariya FMC Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Digitize Facility Maintenance Workflows:** Transform manual, fragmented maintenance processes into streamlined digital workflows
- **Enable Multi-Stakeholder Coordination:** Connect 7 user types (tenants, building associations, FMC staff) through unified platform
- **Improve Response Times:** Reduce average maintenance request resolution time by 40%
- **Enhance Transparency:** Provide real-time visibility into maintenance progress for all stakeholders
- **Automate Notifications:** Implement multi-channel notification system (push, WhatsApp, SMS, email)
- **Ensure Quality Control:** Mandate photo/video documentation for work completion verification
- **Scale Operations:** Enable FMCs to manage 3x more buildings without proportional staff increase

### Background Context

Facility Management Companies (FMCs) currently operate in a fragmented ecosystem where maintenance requests flow through disconnected channels - phone calls, emails, paper forms, and various digital systems. This creates operational chaos where requests get lost, response times are unpredictable, and stakeholders lack visibility into the process. The facility management industry is rapidly digitizing, and companies that don't adapt risk losing competitive advantage as tenants increasingly expect digital-first experiences.

Zariya FMC addresses this by providing a unified digital platform that orchestrates the complete facility maintenance lifecycle through an intelligent workflow engine. The solution connects seven distinct user types in a seamless ecosystem where maintenance requests flow automatically through inspection, approval, procurement, execution, and completion phases with real-time visibility at every step.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Zariya FMC will provide a clean, intuitive interface that feels as familiar as modern consumer apps (like WhatsApp or Gmail) while maintaining the professional functionality needed for facility management. The platform should enable users to complete their tasks efficiently with minimal training, focusing on mobile-first design since many users (technicians, tenants) will access it primarily from mobile devices.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Real-time Updates:** Live status changes and notifications without page refreshes
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show essential information first, with detailed views available on demand
- **Contextual Actions:** Action buttons and menus that appear based on user role and request status
- **Multi-channel Notifications:** Seamless integration of in-app notifications with external channels

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Authentication & Onboarding:** Login screen with Google Sign-in, email registration, and invite code validation
2. **Tenant Dashboard:** Overview of all premises, active requests, and quick action buttons for new requests
3. **Request Creation:** Multi-step form for creating maintenance requests with photo/video upload
