# Project Brief: Zariya FMC

## Executive Summary

**Zariya FMC** is a comprehensive fullstack web platform designed to revolutionize facility management operations by digitizing and streamlining the entire maintenance request lifecycle. The platform connects tenants, building associations, FMC staff, and third-party vendors through an integrated workflow that manages everything from initial maintenance requests to final completion and customer satisfaction.

**Primary Problem:** Facility management companies currently struggle with fragmented communication, manual request tracking, delayed response times, and lack of transparency in maintenance workflows, leading to tenant dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies.

**Target Market:** Facility Management Companies managing multiple buildings, Building Association Owners, and their tenant communities.

**Key Value Proposition:** End-to-end digitization of facility maintenance with real-time tracking, automated notifications, AI-powered insights, and seamless multi-stakeholder coordination.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
Facility management companies operate in a fragmented ecosystem where maintenance requests flow through multiple disconnected channels - phone calls, emails, paper forms, and various digital systems. This creates a chaotic environment where requests get lost, response times are unpredictable, and stakeholders lack visibility into the process.

**Impact of the Problem:**
- **Tenant Frustration:** No transparency into request status, uncertain response times, and difficulty tracking maintenance progress
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual request routing, duplicate data entry, and lack of standardized processes
- **Communication Breakdown:** Multiple notification channels (phone, email, SMS) without centralized coordination
- **Quality Control Issues:** No systematic tracking of work completion, before/after documentation, or customer satisfaction
- **Contract Management:** Difficulty managing tenant access based on contract status and invite code systems

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current facility management software focuses on individual aspects (ticketing, work orders, tenant portals) but fails to provide the integrated, end-to-end workflow that connects all stakeholders. They lack the sophisticated notification system, AI-powered insights, and multi-premise management capabilities needed for modern facility operations.

**Urgency & Importance:**
The facility management industry is rapidly digitizing, and companies that don't adapt risk losing competitive advantage. Tenants increasingly expect digital-first experiences, and FMCs need to modernize to meet these expectations while improving operational efficiency.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept & Approach:**
Zariya FMC is a unified digital platform that orchestrates the complete facility maintenance lifecycle through an intelligent workflow engine. The solution connects seven distinct user types in a seamless ecosystem where maintenance requests flow automatically through inspection, approval, procurement, execution, and completion phases with real-time visibility at every step.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Intelligent Workflow Automation:** AI-powered routing and assignment based on request type, location, and staff availability
- **Multi-Channel Notification System:** Unified notifications across push, WhatsApp, SMS, and email with read status tracking
- **Contract-Based Access Control:** Automated tenant access management with invite codes and contract expiry handling
- **Visual Documentation:** Mandatory photo/video capture before/after work completion for quality assurance
- **OTP Verification System:** Customer verification process ensuring work completion before payment approval
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Predictive analytics for recurring issues and operational optimization

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
Unlike fragmented point solutions, Zariya FMC provides the complete ecosystem that FMCs need. The platform addresses every stakeholder's needs while maintaining data integrity and process transparency. The AI integration and automated workflows reduce manual intervention while improving accuracy and speed.

**High-Level Vision:**
A world where facility maintenance is completely digitized, transparent, and efficient - where tenants can request and track maintenance with the same ease as ordering food delivery, and FMCs can operate with the precision and insight of modern SaaS platforms.
